            <h1><em><strong>APMF Certified Mobile Application Developer Course (CMAD) Program</strong></em></h1>
            <p>All Pakistan Memon Federation is a collective voice of more than two million Memons living in Pakistan. APMF
                is a parent institution of 57 member Jamats and organizations. As Memons are famous for their philanthropy
                and generosities, several social and economic projects </p>


            <p>for the betterment of community as well as the society in general are run by them. APMF co-ordinates and performs
                as a hub between the members and provide guidance in their efforts to improve the performance and outcomes
                of their projects.APMFalso runs several socioeconomic projects as well to facilitate the society without
                any discrimination of gender and community. Recent father in the cap is 3rd Annual Job Fair. This year event
                has provided opportunity to 55 potential employers and more than 6 thousand job seekers to mingle under one</p>
            <p>roof. This program is appreciated by both the beneficiaries. The event illustrations the commitment of APMF toward
                elimination of joblessness from the country</p>

            <p>Considering the high unemployment rate of Pakistanis, especially the educated youth, has been a source of deep
                concern for APMF. The general disconnect between efforts and reward in our society resulting in unwillingness
                of our youth to focus and work hard towards long term goals.Given the current global economic environment
                there is only one industry where there is a shortage of trained workforce that is Software Industry. Due
                to shrinking of computers from desktop to palmtop and advancement in Cell Phone technologies, Cell Phone
                Software Applications are the future of the computing world. Internet use on Cell Phones has changed the
                perception of a phone just to talk. It is now a true medium of communication, entertainment and infotainment.There
                is a cut throat competition in the arena where rising number of jobs are waiting for skilled manpower with
                handsome stipend and self-employment feature.</p>
