            "The JenWARE onesies were the hit of the baby shower. The custom letter "a" and handmade quality made this gift really stand out among the cookie-cutter clothes from the department store."
            <br />
            "Thanks for the cool JenWARE barware. I couldn't wait until I found "Mr. Right," so I just bought a set for myself! My friends always want to know where I got them so I send them to your site."
